<h1>What is Multi-AOF?</h1>
Multi-AOF is an edited version of Team AOF's StartServer.bat Script to allow the user to automatically create a MultiMC .ZIP Instance. It also adds extra mods or ressource / shaders packs located in Extra-[Mod/Ressource_Pack/Shader_Pack].

No plans for any port on GNU/Linux systems. If you're using that, then you probably could do what this tool does a million times better than me.

Due to current limitations (from the lack of programming knowledge on my part) the setup is odd but it works.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

1 - Download Multi-AOF via the releases tab (or the "Code" button)

2 - Go to your favorite modpack on CurseForge (ew) that includes server files (example: All Of Fabric 5) and download the server files.

3 - Extract Multi-AOF somewhere (Documents is a good place)

4 - Open the Modpack Archive and find "seerver-setup-config.yaml", extract it in the .minecraft folder of Multi-AOF

5 - Run Multi-AOF.bat (which is also located in .minecraft)

6 - Follow the on-screen prompts

7 - Enjoy !
