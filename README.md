# What is Multi-AOF?
Multi-AOF is an edited version of Team AOF's StartServer.bat Script to allow the user to automatically create a MultiMC .ZIP Instance.
No plans for any port on GNU/Linux systems. If you're using that, then you probably could do what this tool does a million times better than me.

Due to current limitations (from the lack of programming knowledge on my part) the setup is odd but it works.

#Instructions
TBD
